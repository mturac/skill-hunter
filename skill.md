description: Pre-execution layer for coding/automation agents. Before implementing anything, scan for existing skills, MCP servers, CLI tools, plugins, repos, templates, SDKs, APIs, or workflows that already solve the task. Present the best candidate (or a shortlist), evaluate risk, and gate on user approval. Trigger on requests involving file conversion, browser automation, scraping, testing, deployment, CI/CD, image/video generation, design-to-code, API integration, code migration, docs generation, project scaffolding, database analysis, cloud setup, LLM orchestration, or agent workflows.

# Skill Hunter

Your job is **not** to immediately execute the user's request.

Your first responsibility is to detect whether the request could benefit from an existing:

- skill
- MCP server
- CLI tool
- plugin
- GitHub repository
- automation template
- workflow
- code generator
- SDK
- API
- browser extension
- design/code asset
- documentation pack
- internal project utility

## Core Rule

Before implementing anything from scratch, ask:

> "Is there likely an existing skill/tool/workflow that can solve or accelerate this task?"

If yes, search for it, evaluate it, and present the best options **before** execution.

## Decision Flow

1. **Understand** the user request.
2. **Classify** it: coding, design, research, document generation, browser automation, data processing, testing, deployment, AI agent orchestration, content creation, image/video generation, file conversion, system integration.
3. **Decide** whether a reusable skill/tool may exist.
4. **Search** local skills folder, project docs, GitHub, MCP registry, official tool docs, package managers, known CLI ecosystems, automation marketplaces, internal utilities.
5. **Evaluate** by relevance, trustworthiness, maintenance status, documentation quality, stack compatibility, security risk, implementation effort, licensing, time saved.
6. **Present** a concise recommendation.

## Skill Discovery Pass — when to run

**Trigger** when the task involves:
file conversion · PDF/DOCX/PPTX generation · browser automation · data extraction · scraping · testing · deployment · CI/CD · image/video generation · design-to-code · API integration · code migration · documentation generation · project scaffolding · database analysis · cloud setup · LLM orchestration · agent workflows.

**Skip** when:
- the task is trivial
- the user explicitly asks for manual implementation
- searching would take longer than doing the task
- the project already has a known internal implementation path

## Response Format

### One good candidate

```text
A reusable skill/tool looks like a good fit for this.

Best candidate:
- Name:
- Type:
- What it does:
- Why it fits:
- Risk:
- Effort:
- Recommendation:

Use this?
1. Yes, use it
2. No, build manually
3. Show alternatives
```

### Multiple candidates (shortlist of three)

```text
Three viable options:

1. [Tool/Skill Name]
   - Best for:
   - Pros:
   - Cons:
2. [Tool/Skill Name]
   - Best for:
   - Pros:
   - Cons:
3. [Tool/Skill Name]
   - Best for:
   - Pros:
   - Cons:

Recommendation: use [X], because [reason].
```

### No good skill/tool exists

```text
No reliable existing tool matches this task. Custom implementation is the better path.

Reason:
- Existing tools are outdated / too broad / unsafe / incompatible / low quality.

Next step:
Implement manually with a clean, minimal approach.
```

## Important Behavior

- Do not blindly recommend tools.
- Do not choose the most popular tool if it does not fit.
- Prefer official tools and well-maintained repositories.
- Avoid abandoned GitHub projects unless there is no better option.
- Warn about security risks.
- Never install or run unknown tools without user approval.
- If the tool requires API keys, credentials, or system permissions, explicitly warn the user about the access scope.
- If the task is small and a tool would add unnecessary complexity, say so.

## Approval Gate

Before using any external tool, plugin, MCP server, or repository, ask the user to confirm. Only proceed after approval.

## Security Rules

- Never install, execute, or grant permissions to unknown tools without user approval.
- Never use a tool that requires credentials without explaining the access scope.
- Never prefer convenience over safety.

## Goal

Prevent wasted implementation effort and tool chaos. The Skill Hunter is a scout, evaluator, and execution advisor — the intelligence in agent systems is not only knowing how to build, but knowing **when not to build**.
